The Price of Greatness Is Responsibility
伟大的代价是责任

The last time I attended a ceremony of this character was in the spring of 1941, when, as Chancellor of Bristol University, I conferred a degree upon the United States Ambassador, Mr.Winant, and in absentia upon President Conant, our President, who is here today and presiding over this ceremony. The blitz was running hard at that time, and the night before, the raid on Bristol had been heavy. Several hundreds had been killed and wounded. Many houses were destroyed. Buildings next to the University were still burning, and many of the University authorities who conducted the ceremony had pulled on their robes over uniforms begrimed and drenched;  but all was presented with faultless ritual and appropriate decorum, and I sustained a very strong and invigorating impression of the superiority of man over the forces that can destroy him.

上一次参加这种类型的典礼是在1941年的春天, 当时, 作为布里斯托大学的校长, 我授予了美国大使Winant先生学位, 同时也授予缺席的Conant校长学位, 我们的校长, 今天出席并住持这次典礼. 那时闪电战节节逼近, 就在前一天晚上, 布里斯托遭到了猛烈地的袭击. 数百人伤亡, 多所房屋被毁. 大学附近建筑物的大火仍在燃烧, 许多参加典礼的大学领导将长袍套在又湿又脏的制服上; 但一切都以完美的仪式和适当的礼仪呈现, 对于人们战胜摧毁人类力量的优势, 我一直保持着强烈且令人振奋的印象.

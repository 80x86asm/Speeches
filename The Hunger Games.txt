The rule is that once a tribute's name has been pulled from the ball, another eligible boy, if a boy's name has been read, or girl, if a girl's name has been read, can step forward to take his or her place.
规则是: 一旦一个贡品的名字从球中被抽出, 如果是男孩的名字被念出, 另一个符合条件的男孩可以站出来代替他; 如果是女孩的名字, 另一个符合条件的女孩可以站出来代替她.

In some districts, in which winning the reaping is such a great honor, people are eager to risk their lives, the volunteering is complicated.
在一些区, 赢得收割典礼是一个极大的荣耀, 人们渴望冒着生命危险, 因此自愿程序很复杂.

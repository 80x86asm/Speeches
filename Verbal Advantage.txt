Word 3 DIGRESS

To wander, stray from the point, ramble, deviate, go off another direction.
离题, 偏离主题, 东拉西扯, 偏离方向, 转向别的方向.

Digress comes from the Latin digressus, which comes in turn from the prefix dis-, apart, and gradi, to go, walk, step.
Digress源自拉丁语digressus, 而digressus又源于前缀dis-(分开)和gradi(走、步、踏)

Digress means literally to go apart, walk away.
Digress的字面意思是"走开, 步离".

From the same Latin source come ingress, the place you walk in, the entrance; and egress, the place you walk out, the exit.
同样的拉丁语来源还产生了ingress(进入的地方, 即入口)和egress(走出去的地方, 即出口).

Digress once was used of physical wandering or turning aside, but that sense is now archaic, which means old-fashioned.
Digress过去曾用于表示身体上的游走或转向, 但这种用法现在已经是archaic(古语的, 过时的)

Today we do not say, "She turned right and digressed down Main Street." Instead, digress is used of speaking or writing that departs from the main point or subject at hand and wanders off in another direction:
现今, 我们不会说："她向右转, 然后顺着主干道digressed下去了." 相反, digress现在用于指说话或写作偏离主要观点或当前主题，并转向其他方向.

"In a business report or an oral presentation, it's important to stick to the facts and not digress";
"在商业报告或口头陈述中, 紧扣事实而不跑题是非常重要的."

"if she hadn't digressed so much, her lecture would have been more interesting."
"如果她没有离题太多, 她的讲座本可以更有趣."

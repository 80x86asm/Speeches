Word 3 DIGRESS

To wander, stray from the point, ramble, deviate, go off another direction.

Digress comes from the Latin digressus, which comes in turn from the prefix dis-, apart, and gradi, to go, walk, step.

From the same Latin source come ingress, the place you walk in, the entrance; and egress, the place you walk out, the exit.
